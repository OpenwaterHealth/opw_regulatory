The field of medical technology has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with groundbreaking innovations reshaping the landscape of diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. This Wikipedia page is dedicated to providing transparent insight into the regulatory strategy, discussions, and pathway that Openwater has pursued to date with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Openwater LVO Stroke Alert, the Openwater Blood flow Headset, and Openwater Low Intensity Focused (LOFU) Ultrasound Therapy System. 
Among these transformative technologies, Openwater has developed the Openwater LVO Stroke Alert. The Openwater LVO Stroke Alert is intended for use as an early notification system to identify and communicate blood flow data on patients with suspected Large Vessel Occlusion of the internal carotid artery or the proximal middle cerebral artery. The proposed device is indicated for use in pre-hospital settings to allow medical personnel to make better routing decisions for patients suspected of anterior LVO.  This technology along with the Openwater Blood Flow Headset have the potential to provide valuable blood flow data to medical professionals. 
Low intensity focused ultrasound represents another cutting-edge technology that harnesses the power of ultrasound waves at lower energy levels for therapeutic purposes. This technique has shown promise in diverse medical fields, such as targeted drug delivery, tissue regeneration, and neuromodulation. The Openwater Low Intensity Focused (LOFU) Ultrasound Therapy System is intended for safe neurostimulation of the prefrontal cortex. 
As we navigate the intricacies of optical blood flow and low intensity focused ultrasound technologies, this page serves as a valuable resource for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts seeking a comprehensive understanding of the FDA's regulatory oversight in this dynamic intersection of medical science and technology.
